# AdalightCockpit

Small Java control panel (cockpit) for my Adalight.

The idea for the Adalight and most of the software is from https://www.adafruit.com/ (awesome site - check them out).  
Their tutorial for the adalight is here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adalight-diy-ambient-tv-lighting
All the credit goes to them!

Soon IÂ´ll add how-to for the arduino / processing / rxtx part
(the repo is very fresh and highly WIP)

Currently under Manjaro/Arch (my dev system) one has to add itself to uucp user group and give write permissions to /run/lock.
This is of course not the way to go long term.

Note:
Not working right now.
Brought it to life on a Manjaro/Arch/Linux today and upgraded almost everything.
Will write the GUI directly new in swing or fx.
