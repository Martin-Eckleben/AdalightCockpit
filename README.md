# AdalightCockpit

Small Java control panel (cockpit) for my Adalight.

The idea for the Adalight and most of the software is from https://www.adafruit.com/ (awesome site - check them out).  
Their tutorial for the adalight is here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adalight-diy-ambient-tv-lighting
All the credit goes to them!
