# AdalightCockpit

Small Java control panel (cockpit) for my Adalight.

The idea for the Adalight and most of the software is from https://www.adafruit.com/ (awesome site - check them out).  
Their tutorial for the adalight is here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adalight-diy-ambient-tv-lighting
All the credit goes to them!

Soon I´ll add how-to for the arduino / processing / rxtx part
(the repo is very fresh and highly WIP)

P.S. I wrote the buttons / GUI in my childhood - I´ll soon upgrade it to Swing :)
